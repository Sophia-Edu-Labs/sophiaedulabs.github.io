# Intro to the Sophia App

Let's discover the Sophia MVP together.

### Getting Started

Go to the Sophia Homepage by clicking the logo in the navigation bar and **scan the QR-Code** depicted there. This will take you to the Sophia Web-Application. From there, use the typical scrolling gestures to navigate between videos, or simply wait for the videos to play one after another.

### Giving Feedback

As we are working hard to create the best educational App that we can, we love nothing more than getting feedback. If you have three minutes, fill out this form (link); if you have a bit more, schedule a 15-Minute interview with one of the founders here (link).

### Questions

If you have any questions about the Sophia App, just message Friedrich, one of the founders at friedrich@sophiaedulabs.com
